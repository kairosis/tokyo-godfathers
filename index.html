    <p>In modern-day Tokyo, three homeless people's lives are changed forever when they discover a baby girl at a garbage dump on Christmas Eve. As the New Year fast approaches, these three forgotten members of society band together to solve the mystery of the abandoned child and the fate of her parents. Along the way, encounters with seemingly unrelated events and people force them to confront their own haunted pasts, as they learn to face their future, together.

    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <!--source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Godfathers#Themes -->
    <p>The motif of the film is "coincidence" and "family," and the rough plot is about "three main characters who are not related by blood but live together as if they were a real family, and through a miraculous coincidence triggered by a baby, each of them recovers the connection with their original family that they have lost.</p>

    <p>The film does not adopt an overt "mixing of fiction and reality" motif, but a careful look reveals that the relationship between "fiction and reality" is conscious in this film as well. What Kon was conscious of in his direction was "meaningful coincidence,"<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b4ef85_8b2ad2dc2f244d52a99672d26ce9f8f9~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1200,h_675,al_c,q_90/b4ef85_8b2ad2dc2f244d52a99672d26ce9f8f9~mv2.webp" alt="coincidence-in-the-film" class="content-img-1"> in other words, to create a chain of miraculous events to move the story forward. Kon writes in the press sheet, "This film is an attempt to restore in a healthy way the 'miracles and coincidences' that have been pushed into the other world by the weapons of scientific logic," and just as that sentence says, "meaningful coincidences" and "impossible events" happen one after another in the film. In other words, the idea of this film is that the "fiction" of "miracles and coincidences" can be found in the seemingly real life of the homeless in Tokyo. The director's aim is to portray a series of events that could never happen in reality with a sense of reality and persuasiveness that makes it seem possible.</p>

    <p>Kon said: "Homeless people, as the term implies, "have no home," but in this film, it is not just "people who have lost their homes," but also "people who have lost their families," and in that sense, this film is a story about recovering lost relationships with families." The reason why Kon chose homeless people as the main characters is because he was interested in the existence of homeless people even before he came up with the idea of the film project. One of the triggers for Kon to come up with this work was the idea that they are born even in times of affluence, and at the same time, they are supported because the world is affluent, so they may be said to be kept alive by the city. The other idea was the idea of animism in the city, that even the buildings and alleys of the city may have a soul, and that the main characters step into the other world that overlaps the city. Based on a story in which 3 homeless people living like pseudo-families pick up a baby and try to return it to her parents, Kon imagined a story in which the three people enter a "different world" where strange coincidences occur in succession, and they recover their relationship with their families and society through their adventures, <img src="https://viewerscommentary.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/tokyo-godfathers-tokyo-landscape.jpg" alt="tokyo-landscape" class="content-img-2">and another protagonist named "Tokyo" is watching over them. In fact, "landscapes that look like faces," in which the outdoor units of air conditioners and windows are used as eyes and mouths, are embedded in various cuts, which could be said to be the figures of the gods of the city staring at the main characters. These "faces" are not visible from the perspective of the characters, and only the audience can notice them. Kon has also created a fiction here. The film's background is a trick of overlapping two layers of information: "the city scenery = reality for the characters" and "the scenery with faces that only the audience can see = a kind of fiction", even though it is the same single picture.</p>

    <p>The setting of the three main characters, who are not blood related, had the condition that they look like a family. It was not so much an exaggeration as a suggestion of a "new image of the family in the future," but simply a suggestion that Kon's idea of a family with this kind of relationship might be acceptable. Kon's idea was to suggest that it is necessary to find a way for each person to have their own family, rather than a standardized model of what a new family should look like. Kon said that he did not intend to portray homeless people as representatives of weakness and unhappiness, or as a hindrance to society, and that the three are symbols of everyone's weaknesses and regrets rather than real homeless people. He also said they are unhappy not because they are homeless, but because their lives have lost their former glow, and that happiness lies in the process of recovery, which is the story of this work itself.</p>

    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Godfathers#Reception -->
    <p>The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 91% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 74 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The critics consensus states, "Beautiful and substantive, Tokyo Godfathers adds a moving – and somewhat unconventional – entry to the animated Christmas canon." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews." Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, calling it "harrowing and heartwarming."</p>

    <p>Movie critic George Peluranee notes that "Tokyo Godfathers is a film that shows the small yet significant ties that each of us have with supposed strangers, and tells well the story of miracles, family, love, and forgiveness."</p>

    <p>Susan Napier points out that Tokyo Godfathers is part of a trend in anime and manga as depicting families in an increasingly dark fashion, showcasing the problems with traditional families, and attempts by people to construct a "pseudo-family" out of an increasingly fragmented and isolating modern Japanese society. <img src="https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/305747403/Messages.png" alt="a new family together" class="content-img-3">It is put forth that despite the seeming criticisms of traditional families throughout the film, it ends with a more conservative feeling as everyone returns to their traditional/original families. Despite its seemingly traditional ending, the film offers a more radical version of family. Throughout the story these three homeless vagabonds unknowingly form a "pseudo-family" to protect themselves from the outside world and to overcome their personal demons.</p>
